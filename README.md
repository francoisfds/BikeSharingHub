# BikeSharingHub

BikeSharingHub is an Android application that displays the availability of shared bikes in your city.

It uses the [CityBikes API](https://api.citybik.es/v2/) that provides data for more than 400 cities in around 40 countries and displays this data in a list or on an [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) layer thanks to the [osmdroid](https://github.com/osmdroid/osmdroid) library (multiple layers are available).

It is a fork of the [OpenBikeSharing](https://github.com/bparmentier/OpenBikeSharing) application, which adds few improvements for recent Android versions.
